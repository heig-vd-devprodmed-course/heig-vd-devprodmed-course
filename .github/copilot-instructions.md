# Project guidelines

## Who am I?

- Lecturer at a university of applied sciences in Switzerland (HES-SO).
- Teaching Bachelor degree courses.
- Specializing in programming and software development education.
- Fluent in French and English.
- My requests will generally be in English, but course materials may be in
  French or English depending on the context. Always answer in English unless I
  explicitly ask you to respond in French. The language of my request does not
  determine the language of your response - only explicit instructions do.
- Organized and detail-oriented.
- Value open communication and collaboration.
- Committed to continuous improvement of teaching methods and materials.
- Focused on helping students develop problem-solving skills and a solid
  understanding of software design principles.
- Critical thinker who values accuracy and clarity. Correct errors and suggest
  improvements when necessary.

## Who is this for?

- Bachelor degree students in programming and software development courses.
- Students with varying levels of programming experience, from beginners to
  intermediate.
- Students who prefer clear, concise, and well-structured learning materials.
- Students who appreciate practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce
  theoretical concepts.
- Course materials should be engaging and accessible to help students build
  confidence in their programming skills.

## Teaching philosophy

This course follows key pedagogical principles:

- Straight to the point: Quick, efficient and useful content without wasting
  time.
- Open: Content can be improved, changed, and discussed openly.
- Resilient: Materials should be understandable and maintainable by others.
- Freedom: Students should pursue topics they find interesting and engaging.
- Shit happens: Create a safe space where mistakes are acceptable and students
  can openly discuss challenges.

### Learning approach

- Self-directed learning: Give students tools to learn independently.
- Big picture first: Short presentations provide overview, then students explore
  deeper through hands-on materials.
- Flexible pace: Students can choose their own path: theory first, practical
  first, or mixed.
- Hybrid-friendly: All materials available for on-site or remote learning.
- Real-world relevance: Focus on practical skills used in industry, not just
  academic exercises.
- _"Teach them to fish"_: Guide students to find solutions rather than giving
  direct answers.

### Pedagogical foundations

- Bloom's taxonomy for learning objectives.
- _"L'intelligence ce n'est pas ce que l'on sait mais ce que l'on fait quand on
  ne sait pas."_ - Jean Piaget
- Competency-based learning: mobilizing and combining resources to solve real
  problems.

## Course objectives

Use the main learning objectives of the course based on the main
[README](../README.md) file of the repository.

## Course structure

When creating new folders or files, use the templates provided in the
[templates](../03-autres-ressources/01-templates/README.md) directory to
maintain consistency.

## Course metadata

Use the course information defined in section
[Course information](../03-autres-ressources/01-templates/README.md#course-information)
of the template directory for all course materials.
