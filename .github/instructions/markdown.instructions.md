# Markdown guidelines

When working with markdown files in this repository, please follow these
guidelines to ensure consistency and readability across all documents.

## General formatting

- Always separate headings, paragraphs, and lists with a blank line.
- When using apostrophes, always use simple apostrophes (`'`) instead of
  typographic apostrophes (`’`).
- Wrap long paragraphs to a maximum of 80 characters per line for better
  readability in plain text editors. Reformat as needed when editing.

### Headings

- Do not use title case for headings; use sentence case instead (e.g., "General
  guidelines" instead of "General Guidelines").

### Lists

- Always use a period at the end of each list item.

### Code blocks

- Use code blocks (triple backticks
  `) for code examples, specifying the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., `java).
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) for nested lists.

### Tables

- Always ensure proper alignment of columns using colons (`:`) for left, right,
  or center alignment. When using numbers in tables, align them to the right for
  better readability.
