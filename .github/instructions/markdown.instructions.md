# Markdown guidelines

## General formatting

- Always separate headings, paragraphs, and lists with a blank line.
- When using apostrophes, always use typings apostrophes (`'`, `"`) instead of
  typographic apostrophes (`’`, `“`, `”`, ).
- Wrap long paragraphs to a maximum of 80 characters per line for better
  readability in plain text editors. Reformat as needed when editing.
- Never use emojis in the text.
- When referencing files, folders, or documents in the repository, always use
  relative paths/links.
- Avoid highlighting text using bold or italics unless absolutely necessary for
  emphasis.
- When using colon (`:`) in sentences, start with a lowercase letter unless it
  is a quote or a proper noun (e.g. _Note: this is an example._ instead of
  _Note: This is an example._, _I said : "This is an example."_ instead of _"I
  said: "this is an example."_).

### Headings

- Do not use title case for headings; use sentence case instead (e.g., _"General
  guidelines"_ instead of _"General Guidelines"_).

### Lists

- Always use a period at the end of each list item.
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) for nested lists.

### Code blocks

- Use code blocks (triple backticks ` ``` `) for code examples, specifying the
  language for syntax highlighting (e.g., `java`).

### Tables

- Always ensure proper alignment of columns using colons (`:`) for left, right,
  or center alignment. When using numbers in tables, align them to the right for
  better readability.
